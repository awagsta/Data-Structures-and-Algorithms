# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repository contains projects from the data structures and algorithms course. A brief description of each is provided below. More details can be found in the project header files.

##Int_Set
A straightforward integer implementation of the set data type.

##Template_Sequence
A templated implementation of the sequence data type.

##Remove_bad_split_good
Primarily an exercise in pointer manipulaton, the function in the llcpImp erases unwanted data from a linked list, while splitting desired data among 3 seperate lists. A requirement of the project mandated it was all done within one function. As a result, it ended up being quite large!

##List_Traversal
A class focused on width/depth traversal of a linked list of linked lists.

##High_Index_Neg
Implementation of a recursive function that seeks out the smallest negative value in a given array, and prints the index
of the element. In the case of equally small values, the larger element is returned.

##Sorted_merge
Recursive implementation of a function that takes two linked lists and recursively empties and sorts their contents into a third list in non-decreasing order.

##Bin_tree
An implementation of the binary search tree data structure.

##Priority_Queue
An implementation of priority queue using a heap.
